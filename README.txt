Source format: ICO. Destination format: TIFF.

***HOW TO BUILD***

> We start by running the 'make' command which uses the makefile to generate an executable file named 'my_project' 
  and a '.o' file for every '.c' file in the project directory.

> Now we have some new files in the directory.
  To get the final product, the executable file generated in the above step, namely 'my_product' can be run by
  typing ./my_product

> "Enter name of ico file with extension: " , appears on the screen, Enter the ICO file to be converted into TIFF
  format and press ENTER key.

> A final TIFF product, named "product.tiff" appears in the project directory.

> The extra files generated in step-1, is of no further use to the user. This can be removed from project
  directory using the command 'make clean'. This removes the executable 'my_project' and '.o' files.
